# Bootstrapping Challenge

## Pat Fuller and Mia Iseman

# GOAL: 

Use bootstrapping to estimate a confidence interval for the average of all possible album reviews using the Pitchfork music database. 

## Reasoning: 

In a separate project, we are trying to perform hypothesis tests on data from the <a href= 'https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data'> Pitchfork music database</a>. 

Our hypothesis tests assume the Pitchfork music database to essentially "be" the population of music reviews. But, what about reviews that have yet to be written? Reviews from other websites?  Here, we use bootstrapping to say with 99.9% confidence that the Pitchfork population mean is within .025 of the overall review population mean. Since we are working with review scores between zero and ten, this is a miniscule and acceptable amount of error to move on with the assumption that the overall population mean is essentially the mean of the Pitchfork data.
